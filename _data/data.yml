    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      While I am still yet young, my career as a student has been quite successful. I 
      have been on the Dean's list at Ball State University since my freshman year with a 4.0 
      GPA, as well as graduating High School with honors. The little corporate experience I do have 
      I was able to be successful at as well, quickly integrating myself into the company and 
      succeeding in my role.

      - degree: Honors Deploma
        university: Crown Point High School
        time: 2017 - 2020
        details: |
          During High School I was a successful student, performing well in my 
          classes and learning well. I was able to complete a variety of AP classes 
          while succeeding on my AP tests, with my proudest achievements being a 
          5 on AP Computer Science and a 5 on AP Calculus. I also was a top student 
          in my computer science classes, being well known by my teachers in the programs.
      - degree: Bachelors of Science in Computer Science with a Data Analysis Focus
        university: Ball State University
        time: 2021 - Present
        details: |
          I have approached my time at Ball State University as a man hungry for 
          learning; I have made sure to make ample use of the opportunities I have 
          been afforded to grow as much as I can as a life long learner as well as a 
          computer scientist. I have also been a part of multiple groups on campus, 
          the most prominent of which is being a student leader at the Ball State 
          Christian Campus House, where I was able to develop leadership skills 
          that proved to be crucial in my later classes and career experiences.

        time: May 2023 - August 2023
        company: Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis
        details: |
          I was a tech intern working for the Summer at Eli Lilly. I was 
          able to demonstrate my skills by learning a new technology 
          quickly and efficiently, as well as being able to deliver a 
          project with that new technology much earlier than required. I 
          also learned to be able to connect well with fellow employees and 
          grow meaningful work relationships that build each other up.
