career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      While I am still yet young, my career as a student has been quite successful. I 
      have been on the Dean's list at Ball State University since my freshman year with a 4.0 
      GPA, as well as graduating High School with honors. The little corporate experience I do have 
      I was able to be successful at as well, quickly integrating myself into the company and 
      succeeding in my role.
education:
    title: Education
    info:
      - degree: Honors Deploma
        university: Crown Point High School
        time: 2017 - 2020
        details: |
          During High School I was a successful student, performing well in my 
          classes and learning well. I was able to complete a variety of AP classes 
          while succeeding on my AP tests, with my proudest achievements being a 
          5 on AP Computer Science and a 5 on AP Calculus. I also was a top student 
          in my computer science classes, being well known by my teachers in the programs.
      - degree: Bachelors of Science in Computer Science with a Data Analysis Focus
        university: Ball State University
        time: 2021 - Present
        details: |
          I have approached my time at Ball State University as a man hungry for 
          learning; I have made sure to make ample use of the opportunities I have 
          been afforded to grow as much as I can as a life long learner as well as a 
          computer scientist. I have also been a part of multiple groups on campus, 
          the most prominent of which is being a student leader at the Ball State 
          Christian Campus House, where I was able to develop leadership skills 
          that proved to be crucial in my later classes and career experiences.

    info:
      - role: Tech@Lilly Intern
        time: May 2023 - August 2023
        company: Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis
        details: |
          I was a tech intern working for the Summer at Eli Lilly. I was 
          able to demonstrate my skills by learning a new technology 
          quickly and efficiently, as well as being able to deliver a 
          project with that new technology much earlier than required. I 
          also learned to be able to connect well with fellow employees and 
          grow meaningful work relationships that build each other up.

projects:
    title: Projects
    info:
      - project: Pokemon Go Pokedex
        details: |
          During my sophomore year, I was a big fan of Pokemon (still am), and 
          wanted to create a Pokedex for Pokemon go that is easily accessible from 
          the phone. With this in mind, I was able to use Kotlin to connect with the 
          Bulbapedia API as well as the PokeGo API, and then using those connections 
          I was able to successfully create an app that has an entry for each Pokemon 
          in Pokemon Go including their stats and images. This project taught me a lot 
          about API connection, especially how to figure it out in languages that have 
          less documentation (such as Kotlin).

      - project: Punk API Beer Application
        details: 
          During my sophomore year, I was part of a team that was required to build 
          out an application using an API that allows user interaction. With this 
          goal in mind, my team and I used Punk API (a beer API, as one of my groupmates 
          was a drinking aficionado) to create an application that can suggest beers based 
          on what food you want to drink the beer with, what level of color you what, what 
          level of alcohol you want, and other thing, as well as being able to suggest a 
          random beer. This project taught me not only the value of teamwork, but how to 
          efficiently scope out and sprint projects as a team.
